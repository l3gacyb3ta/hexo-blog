Well, this was a pain in the butt.  
I didn't feel like messing with github actions again, as I _hate_ that thing with a **passion**. So I was looking through the hexo docs and I found a usefull one-command deploy option. All you have to do is add this little tidbit to your _config.yaml.  
```
deploy:
  type: git
  repo: https://github.com/<username>/<project>
  # example, https://github.com/l3gacyb3ta/l3gacyb3ta.github.io
  branch: <whatever branch you use>
```  
You also have to install hexo-deployer-git, which is simple, just use this:  
```$ npm install hexo-deployer-git --save```  
  
And then all you have to do to deploy is:  
```$ hexo deploy```
  
That was easy!
